# Project 7 : Implementing a scoring model
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model, for a bank, to predict if a customer will be able to pay back a loan.

The idea is to create a dashboard accessible to bank advisors to help them advise their clients more accurately

The project is organized as follows : an API predicting the probabilty that a customer of the bank does not repay his loan and a dashboard that will query the API and display different informations about the client

Summary of the project :
  - Source code for the Dasboard
  - Source code of the API
  - Feature Engineering & Modeling Notebooks
You can also acces the API here and the dashboard here
